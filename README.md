COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It is the disease implicated in the 2019â€“2020 coronavirus epidemic. The primary mode of infection in humans is a human-to-human transmission, which generally occurs via respiratory droplets from infected individuals when they sneeze, cough, or expires. It has an incubation period of between 2 to 17 days. Transmission stopped by washing hands, good hygiene, and wearing surgical masks. The disease may initially present itself as asymptomatic or with few symptoms or may develop into a fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles, and tiredness, with further development into pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. There are no vaccines nor effective treatments, with efforts typically confined to the management of symptoms and supportive measures.
